# ðŸ”  Font Detection App

[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://fonttestingapp.streamlit.app/)

This is a demo of the assignment in the Foundations of Data Science Course (CS F320). This repository hosts the front end for a Streamlit app that can recognize fonts using a model trained on a custom dataset. The app allows users to upload images of text, and it will predict the font used in the image. The model has been trained on a diverse set of fonts to ensure accurate recognition.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the Repository

   ```bash
   https://github.com/joejo-joestar/Font-Detection-App.git

2. Install the requirements

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the app

   ```bash
